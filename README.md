# Material_Recognition_CNN
This project aims to perform material recognition task on [Flickr Material Database](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lavanya/fmd.html) and [Materials in Context Database](http://opensurfaces.cs.cornell.edu/publications/minc/).
The pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model [VGG19](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) is refined to fit the dataset. 

## Data split

## VGG19 on FMD

## VGG19 on MINC-2500
